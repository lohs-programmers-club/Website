Welcome to the github repository powering the LOHS Software Club website.


## Pages
***Home*** - A list of important links and resources for club members

***Rules*** - The club rules that will be enforced by all staff and admins. ONLY club admins may edit this page and, as per the rules, must announce to the whole club using `@everyone` when they do.

***Roles*** - This page describes the responsibilities/purpose of each role in the club. Same editing restrictions as ***Rules*** above.

***FAQ*** - This is the page for useful guides and answers to common questions. Anyone may contribute a question/answer, however, admins have final say over what is reasonable to publish. Longer answers need to be written up in a google doc with "Anyone with the link" or "anyone at LOSD with the link" permissions. To preserve these docs, please share them with one of the club admins.
