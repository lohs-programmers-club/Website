<h1>Club Rules</h1>

<i>Here are the basic guidelines for all members of the LOHS Software Club. These rules were created so we as a club can make and maintain a safe environment for everyone to learn about technology. If you cannot follow these guidelines, you may be warned, muted, kicked or banned from the club as determined by the admins. Anything not expressly or implicitly authorized in these rules should not be considered official</i>

<h2>Club Values</h2>
<ol id="rules">
    <li>Learning</li>
        <p>The first and foremost reason this club is here is so we can all learn from each other. Do your best to answer questions that others ask in a respectful way so that we can all move our knowledge forward.</p>
    <li>Respect</li>
        <p>We respect one another for who they are. Trolling, hate-speech, rudeness and intent to start a fight is not allowed. Additionally, mental health issues are not a joke. That includes stuff like self-harm and injuring yourself/the people around you.</p>
        
    <li>Safety</li>
        <p>As a club, we want to provide a safe and inclusive space for people to participate in the club. Everyone deserves the right to feel safe and secure online. If you feel like something&#39;s not right, please contact an admin.</p>
</ol>

<h2>Club Guidelines</h2>
<ol id="rules">
    <li>Usernames</li>
        <p>Club members will need to use their first and last name (i.e. John Doe) as their nickname in the discord server. This makes it easier for new members to get to know people and easily @mention the intended person. Please speak to an admin if you commonly go by a different name and they will change it at their discretion.</p>
    <li>No spamming</li>
        <p>Spamming of any kind is not allowed here. This includes repeatedly posting random characters for no reason, random pings, advertisements, ASCII art, copy &amp; pasting long text that is out of context, voice changers, music, yelling, and excessively swearing all fall under this category.</p>
    <li>No Racism</li>
        <p>Everyone is different. People by nature have different cultures, skin color, and the likes and we respect that. Please be respectful to all members of the club. Everyone deserves to be included.</p>
    <li>Swearing</li>
        <p>Swearing is allowed in the club chat channels as long as everybody participating is okay with it. If someone says they do not like swearing, please stop.</p>
    <li>Club Roles</li>
        <p>Promotions/demotions of club members are to be decided upon by the admins as a whole. Members are expected to stick to the roles and responsibilities of their assigned rank and the administration reserves the right to take appropriate measures when necessary to uphold these guidelines. If you disagree with a decision, please politely bring it up with an administrator.</p>
    <li>Changes to the Rules</li>
        <p>Any admin may change any rule at any time provided that the change is approved by a majority of the other admins and the change is announced in the announcements channel on discord.</p>
