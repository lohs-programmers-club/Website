<h1>Member Roles</h1>

<ul id="roles">
    <li id="admin">Administrator/Owner</li>
        <p>The administrators are the core decision-making body of the club. They are responsible for making decisions and managing things such as club projects, fundraisers, events, promotions field trips and any other major decisions for the club. All decisions need to be agreed upon as a unit and all administrators/owners are considered equally ranked and have full permissions and access to everything.</p>
    <li id="verified">Verified Member</li>
        <p>Verified members are those who are official members of the club. While anyone is free to join and leave the discord whenever they want using the never-expiring link, verified members have more privileges in the club chat rooms, such as the use of reactions, posting links, and attaching files. Club members are encouraged to show up at meetings and can be asked to help out with more admin-like responsibilities if the admins see that they are helpful, positive and actively involved with the club.</p>
    <li id="member">Member</li>
        <p>Anyone is free to join and leave the discord whenever they want using the never-expiring link available on this website. This role acts like a preview role for anyone wishing to preview the club before officially committing to a membership. As a regular member, you are free to read and send messages from all non-restricted chats just like any other club members, however, only club members</p>
